Golf is a great game but in decline. Lots of people have their opinions on why:

I have mine...

Today, most players play for a "score" (i.e. 99, 89, 79). As gratifying as it can be to finally break 100 (or 90, or 80), it is much more likely that a golfer will shoot a score right around their average ability.

Golf originated as a game. Like many other games it was meant to be played by two people, against each other. However, at some point "old man par" came in to play and the game switched from a competition between competitors to an individual game against an imaginary (and unbeatable) opponent. Despite the fact that shooting a personal best or playing against "old man par" can be entertaining, there is no substitute for the exciting back and forth that a match between two competitors can provide.

I firmly believe, match play is the most entertaining form of golf and this app is designed with the sole purpose of facilitating just that. Find a friend. Figure out your handicaps. Play a match.
